# LCL-XL programmeren

Hierin hebben we alle blocks die we bij LCL-XL programmeren nodig hebben

## Blocks

This package includes the following new MakeCode drawers and blocks, helping to abstract pin read/write concepts into simple-to-understand blocks:

* OLED package ([source](https://github.com/Tinkertanker/pxt-oled-ssd1306))
* Crash Sensor: blocks to enable the crash sensor (sets pin mode to pull up), and detect when pressed
* PIR Sensor: block to test if sensor is giving an ON signal
* Soil Moisture Sensor: block to retrieve the soil moisture reading from the sensor
* ADKeypad: blocks to test for each button pressed

## Supported targets

* for PXT/microbit
